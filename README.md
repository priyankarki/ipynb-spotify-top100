# How is Spotify Changing the Music Industry?

The inspiration for this project was based off of this episode of Vox's Switched on Pop podcast titled, "How Streaming Changed the Sound of Pop" (link), which discusses the on going changes in the music industry and specifically how these changes are caused by streaming services' as a platform for popular music. The podcast along with the articles articles linked below consider the many variables that need to be considred with the said changes in music.

Using a dataset I found on Kaggle, which lists the top 100 most streamed songs on Spotify at the end of 2019, I wanted to answer questions regarding changes in BPM and length of tracks, over the past three years of the top 100 most streamed songs.
